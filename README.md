I am a self-taught researcher, theorist, developer, creator, and thinker who thrives at the extremes of :
**Artificial intelligence - quantum computing - biomimicry - neuro-inspired systems - maths - physics - Probability - Robotics - Machine Learning - Philosophy - Linguistics - Programming Language Design - Logic - Graph Theory - Game Theory - Academic Research - Psychology**

**NeuroDose([https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/NeuroDose])** - Help biohackers fine-tune stimulant use to enhance focus, energy, and productivity while minimizing side effects.  It combines pharmacokinetic modeling, 3D brain visualization, and interactive analytics to provide insights into supplement intake, concentration levels, and circadian alignment.

Experience of **Wisdom** and **Deep trees of interrelated knowledge** are my drugs. **Flow** is my optimum and natural state. Living in physical reality and doing "social chores" are my statements of **skin in the game**. My brain is a **multiplexer**.


Always More coming soon ...
