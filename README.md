Self-taught College Dropout. My brain is a **multiplexer**.

# Projects

- **[NeuroDose](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/NeuroDose)** - Help biohackers fine-tune stimulant use to enhance focus, energy, and productivity while minimizing side effects.  It combines pharmacokinetic modeling, 3D brain visualization, and interactive analytics to provide insights into supplement intake, concentration levels, and circadian alignment.
- **[Neural](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/neural)** - This project introduces a new programming language designed specifically for defining neural network models.
- **[HPCS.jl](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/HPCS.jl)** - Building a High-Performance-Computer Simulator in Julia
- **[Robust Î»](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/Robust-Lambda)**
- **Formal Trace** - Decompilation into formal logic, real-time combinatorial visualization, and mathematical program route modeling
