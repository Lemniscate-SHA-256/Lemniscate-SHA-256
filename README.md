I am a self-thaught researcher, theorist, developer, creator, and thinker who thrives at the extremes of :

**Artificial intelligence - quantum computing - biomimicry - neuro-inspired systems - maths - physics - Probability - Robotics - Machine Learning - Philosophy - Linguistics.**

Experience of **Wisdom** and **Deep trees of interrelated knowledges** are my drugs. π
**Flow** is my optimum and natural state. 
Living in physical reality and doing "social chores" are my statements of **skin in the game**.

Join me, if you want to go down the rabbit hole. Φ
Take no pills, pass conventional and unconvential paths, create your path.

I'm always changing, my brain is a **multiplexer**.
