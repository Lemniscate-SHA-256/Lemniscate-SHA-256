Self-taught College Dropout. My brain is a **multiplexer**.

# Projects

- **[NeuroDose](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/NeuroDose)** - Help biohackers fine-tune stimulant use to enhance focus, energy, and productivity while minimizing side effects.  It combines pharmacokinetic modeling, 3D brain visualization, and interactive analytics to provide insights into supplement intake, concentration levels, and circadian alignment.
- **[Neural](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/neural)** - This project introduces a new programming language designed specifically for defining neural network models, visualizing, and Researching.
- **[HPCS.jl](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/HPCS.jl)** - Building a High-Performance-Computer Simulator in Julia
- **[Robust Î»](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/Robust-Lambda)** - Building a functional untyped lambda calculus interpreter with a visual reduction tracer.
- **[Formal Trace](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/Formal-Trace)** - Decompilation into formal logic, real-time combinatorial visualization, and mathematical program route modeling
- **[Dissect](https://github.com/Lemniscate-SHA-256/Dissect)** - Automatically detect, analyze, and visualize algorithms in codebases
